# Covid-19-Data-Analysis-
The following project is a Data Science project that makes an analysis on Covid-19 data obtained from the [John Hopkins dataset](https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19). It was a project done over a period during this summer for my undergraduate degree but I have removed all details of my university from the Notebooks. 

### Specifications 
The project is broken into three visualisations. 
* Visualisation One - This visualisation is broken into the following : A linear line plot, a log line plot, and a rolling average of three days.
* Visualisation Two - Visualisation Two consists of plotting graphs by the days since the 100th confirmed case and the days since the 10th death and recovery. 
* Visualisaton Three - This visualisation plot the total cases against the daily increase of cases. The two axes are logarithmic.

### Libraries and Modules 
The main two modules that were used were Pandas and Matplotlib as part of the project was to become skilled in using them both in tandem to eachother. The modules that were used include: 
* Pandas
* Matplotlib
* Numpy
* Datetime
